The Problem Statement : 
    given a pokemon image, detect the image belongs to which of the following pokemon   
    * pikachu
    * Bulbasaur
    * Charmandar
Image Representatin:
    images are prented as pixels.
    

THE MODEL:
    1. Multi-layer Neural Network MODEL
    2. Activation Function - "relu/tanh"
    3. Final layer units : 3
    4. Final layer Activation Function- softmax

The softmax Function:
    1. It is generalised version of sigmoid function.
    2. It generates probability distribution accross multiple classes.
